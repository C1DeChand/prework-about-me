      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an ex groundskeeper, housekeeper, tire technician, warehouse worker, machinist, manager, delivery driver. This should be easy, right?</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Seattle, WA.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Shooting ranges, the gym (with friends), getting nachos and margaritas, learning new languages, and video games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is anything that I could do anywhere at any time. Such as, on a mountain, or on a beach, or in the air...or sitting at home while watching netflix.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>This might be a shocker, I'm not sure...But I think I'm still in Seattle, WA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Let us refer to the "dream job" thought. Oh, and it seems to pay better than everything I've previously had the pleasure of doing.</p>
